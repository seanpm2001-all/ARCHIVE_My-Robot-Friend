# My robot friend

This is an old project I rediscovered in my Arduino folder titled `/My robot friend/` when searching for files to delete that I had already backed up (since I was low on space) this project was created in 2 parts: the C++ portion was created when I was lonely, and wanted to try out my Arduino kit, but didn't fully grasp the instructions, and the other portion was made in my High School Computer science class B (Python) after I completed the Python portion, and had time to work with an actual robot. As such, the script may or not work, as I never completed the robot, but I did have access to robotics libraries.

The project is dubbed `SeanBot` and it is written in Scratch 2. The incomplete rewrite is written in C++11. The C++ rewrite was created when I was very lonely, and wanted someone to talk to, whether it be artificial or biological. It is not my proudest work, I am actually a lot more proud of the Scratch version.

This project was re-uploaded to archive the original premise. I had to write this description tonight to clear up the purpose of the project.
